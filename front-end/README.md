# Frontend Project Structure Guide
## Overview
Welcome to the frontend project structure guide for the Comrade Marketplace e-commerce website. This document aims to provide a clear understanding of the project's directory structure, organization, and the purpose of each directory and file. This guide will help you navigate the project effectively and collaborate efficiently with your team members.

## Directory Structure
```markdown
Copy code
/src
  /assets
    - Contains static assets such as images and stylesheets.
  /components
    - Contains reusable UI components organized by functionality.
    - /common: Contains common layout components like Header and Footer.
    - /product: Contains components related to displaying product information.
    - /cart: Contains components related to managing the shopping cart.
    - /auth: Contains components for user authentication and registration.
  /contexts
    - Contains React context providers managing global state.
    - AuthContext.tsx: Manages user authentication state.
    - CartContext.tsx: Manages shopping cart state.
  /pages
    - Contains higher-level components representing different pages/routes of the application.
    - Home.tsx: Home page component.
    - Products.tsx: Products listing page component.
    - ProductDetailPage.tsx: Product detail page component.
    - CartPage.tsx: Shopping cart page component.
    - CheckoutPage.tsx: Checkout page component.
  /services
    - Contains service modules handling API requests and authentication.
    - api.ts: Functions for making API requests to the backend.
    - auth.ts: Functions for handling user authentication.
  /styles
    - Contains global stylesheets and variables.
    - global.css: Global styles that apply to the entire application.
    - variables.css: CSS variables for consistent theming and styling.
/App.tsx
  - Root component of the application where routing and global providers are typically set up.
/index.tsx
  - Entry point of the application where React is initialized and the root component is rendered.
```
## Guide
- /assets:<br/>
This directory is dedicated to storing static assets such as images and stylesheets used throughout the application.

- /components:<br/>
Contains reusable UI components organized by functionality. Each subdirectory represents a specific category of components, making it easier to locate and reuse components across the application.

- /contexts:<br/>
Houses React context providers managing global state. These contexts are essential for managing user authentication and the shopping cart state across multiple components.

- /pages:<br/>
Contains higher-level components representing different pages or routes of the application. Each page component corresponds to a specific URL route and encapsulates the logic and UI for that particular page.

- /services:<br/>
Contains service modules responsible for handling API requests and authentication. These services abstract away the implementation details of interacting with external APIs, promoting separation of concerns and reusability.

- /styles:<br/>
Stores global stylesheets and variables used for consistent styling and theming across the application. Global stylesheets define the overall look and feel of the application, while variables provide flexibility and maintainability.

- App.tsx: <br/>
The root component of the application where routing and global providers are typically set up. This component serves as the entry point for rendering the application and orchestrating the overall application logic.

- index.tsx:<br/>
The entry point of the application where React is initialized and the root component is rendered. This file bootstraps the React application and mounts it to the DOM.

## Conclusion
This frontend project structure is designed to promote modularity, reusability, and maintainability, enabling efficient development and collaboration among team members.<br/>
By adhering to this structure and understanding the purpose of each directory and file, you can navigate the project effectively and contribute to its success.

If you have any questions or need further clarification on any aspect of the project structure, feel free to reach out to the team lead or refer to the project documentation.

Happy coding!
